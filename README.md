# GPEA: A Green Pixel Engine for Analysis (and its derivative, the Eureka Variant)

## Overview

The GPEA and GPEureka algorithms are algorithms designed to measure the 
growth rate of plants using overhead cameras (a color camera for the GPEA
algorithm, and an infrared camera for the GPEureka algorithm).

Their inner workings are documented in [paper.ipynb](https://github.com/colewebb/gpea/blob/testing/paper.ipynb)
on the testing branch (the version of paper.ipynb on the main branch is 
frequently out of date).
